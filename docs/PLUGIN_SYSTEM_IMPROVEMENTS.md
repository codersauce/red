# Red Editor Plugin System Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a prioritized improvement plan for the Red editor's plugin system. The improvements are categorized by priority (High/Medium/Low) and implementation difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard), focusing on enhancing stability, developer experience, and functionality.

## Priority Matrix

### High Priority + Easy Implementation
These should be tackled first as they provide immediate value with minimal effort.

#### 1. Implement Missing Buffer Change Events
**Priority:** High | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Impact:** Critical for many plugins

Currently, the `buffer:changed` event is documented but not implemented. This is essential for plugins that need to react to content changes.

**Implementation:**
- Add notification call in `Editor::notify_change()`
- Emit events with buffer ID and change details
- Include line/column information for the change

#### 2. Fix Memory Leak in Timer System
**Priority:** High | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Impact:** Prevents memory issues

The timeout system never cleans up completed timers from the global HashMap.

**Implementation:**
- Add cleanup after timer completion
- Consider using a different data structure (e.g., BTreeMap with expiration)
- Add timer limit per plugin

#### 3. Add Plugin Error Context
**Priority:** High | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Impact:** Major DX improvement

Plugin errors currently lack debugging information.

**Implementation:**
- Capture and format JavaScript stack traces
- Add plugin name to error messages
- Log detailed errors to the debug log with line numbers

### High Priority + Medium Implementation

#### 4. Plugin Lifecycle Management
**Priority:** High | **Difficulty:** Medium | **Impact:** Critical for stability

Plugins currently cannot be deactivated or cleaned up properly.

**Implementation:**
- Add `deactivate()` export support in plugins
- Track event listeners per plugin
- Implement cleanup on plugin reload/disable
- Add enable/disable commands

#### 5. Buffer Manipulation APIs
**Priority:** High | **Difficulty:** Medium | **Impact:** Enables rich editing plugins

Current API only allows opening buffers, not editing them.

**Implementation:**
- Add insert/delete/replace operations with position parameters
- Expose cursor position and selection APIs
- Add transaction support for multiple edits
- Include undo/redo integration

#### 6. Expand Event System
**Priority:** High | **Difficulty:** Medium | **Impact:** Enables reactive plugins

Many useful events are missing from the current implementation.

**Implementation:**
- Add cursor movement events (throttled)
- Mode change notifications
- File save/open events
- Selection change events
- Window focus/blur events

### High Priority + Hard Implementation

#### 7. Plugin Isolation
**Priority:** High | **Difficulty:** Hard | **Impact:** Security and stability

All plugins share the same runtime, allowing interference.

**Implementation:**
- Migrate to separate V8 isolates per plugin
- Implement secure communication between isolates
- Add resource limits per plugin
- Consider using Deno's permissions system

### Medium Priority + Easy Implementation

#### 8. Command Discovery API
**Priority:** Medium | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Impact:** Better UX

No way to list available plugin commands programmatically.

**Implementation:**
- Add `red.getCommands()` API
- Include command descriptions/metadata
- Expose in command palette automatically

#### 9. Plugin Configuration Support
**Priority:** Medium | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Impact:** Better customization

Plugins cannot access configuration values.

**Implementation:**
- Add `red.getConfig(key)` API
- Support plugin-specific config sections
- Add config change notifications

#### 10. Improve Logging API
**Priority:** Medium | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Impact:** Better debugging

Current logging is file-only and hard to access.

**Implementation:**
- Add log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Create in-editor log viewer command
- Add structured logging with metadata

### Medium Priority + Medium Implementation

#### 11. TypeScript Definitions
**Priority:** Medium | **Difficulty:** Medium | **Impact:** Major DX improvement

No type safety for plugin development.

**Implementation:**
- Generate .d.ts files for the plugin API
- Publish as npm package for IDE support
- Include inline documentation
- Add type checking in development mode

#### 12. File System APIs
**Priority:** Medium | **Difficulty:** Medium | **Impact:** Enables utility plugins

Plugins need controlled file access for many use cases.

**Implementation:**
- Add permission-based file APIs
- Support read/write with user confirmation
- Include directory operations
- Add file watching capabilities

#### 13. Plugin Testing Framework
**Priority:** Medium | **Difficulty:** Medium | **Impact:** Quality improvement

No way to test plugins currently.

**Implementation:**
- Create mock implementations of editor APIs
- Add test runner integration
- Support async testing
- Include coverage reporting

### Medium Priority + Hard Implementation

#### 14. Hot Reload System
**Priority:** Medium | **Difficulty:** Hard | **Impact:** Major DX improvement

Requires editor restart for plugin changes.

**Implementation:**
- Watch plugin files for changes
- Implement safe reload with state preservation
- Handle cleanup of old version
- Add development mode flag

#### 15. Plugin Package Management
**Priority:** Medium | **Difficulty:** Hard | **Impact:** Ecosystem growth

No standard way to distribute plugins.

**Implementation:**
- Define plugin manifest format
- Create installation/update commands
- Add dependency resolution
- Consider plugin registry/marketplace

### Low Priority + Easy Implementation

#### 16. More UI Components
**Priority:** Low | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Impact:** Richer plugins

Limited to text drawing and pickers currently.

**Implementation:**
- Add status bar API
- Support floating windows/tooltips
- Add progress indicators
- Include notification system

#### 17. Plugin Metadata
**Priority:** Low | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Impact:** Better management

Plugins lack descriptive information.

**Implementation:**
- Support package.json for plugins
- Add version, author, description fields
- Show in plugin list command
- Add compatibility information

### Low Priority + Medium Implementation

#### 18. Inter-Plugin Communication
**Priority:** Low | **Difficulty:** Medium | **Impact:** Advanced scenarios

Plugins cannot communicate with each other.

**Implementation:**
- Add message passing system
- Support plugin dependencies
- Include shared state mechanism
- Add permission model

#### 19. LSP Integration APIs
**Priority:** Low | **Difficulty:** Medium | **Impact:** IDE-like plugins

Limited access to LSP functionality.

**Implementation:**
- Expose completion, hover, definition APIs
- Add code action support
- Include diagnostics access
- Support custom LSP servers

### Low Priority + Hard Implementation

#### 20. Plugin Marketplace
**Priority:** Low | **Difficulty:** Hard | **Impact:** Ecosystem growth

No central place to discover plugins.

**Implementation:**
- Build web-based registry
- Add search/browse commands
- Include ratings/reviews
- Support automatic updates
